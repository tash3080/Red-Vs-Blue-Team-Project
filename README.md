# Red-Vs-Blue-Team-Project

## Assessment, Analysis,  and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

In this project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I attack a vulnerable VM within a given environment, ultimately gaining root access to the target machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the attack engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for a report.

Then, I interpret the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that had been successfully performed.
